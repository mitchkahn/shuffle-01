Overplay_Docroot
================

The document root for Overplay TV

This is the Overplay TV docroot to start collaborating on our Overplay TV code.

I know nothing about Git or how these things work, so please feel free to show me what to do.

I will say, this directory has two external components. 

jquery - currently I get this from Google, but i will probably change so I can work offline.

bootstrap - a library to make my stuff look prettier.

There are two directories that have info:

data - where I keep the json files Overplay uses to track scores

images - duh.
